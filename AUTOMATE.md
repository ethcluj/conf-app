# ETHCluj Conference App Deployment Automation

This document outlines strategies for automating the deployment of the ETHCluj conference application to minimize manual steps when setting up on a new server.

## Current Manual Steps

1. **Initial Server Setup**:
   - Creating a non-root user (`deploy`)
   - Setting up SSH key authentication
   - Configuring firewall rules
   - Installing Docker and Docker Compose

2. **Application Deployment**:
   - Cloning the repository
   - Creating the `.env` file with environment variables
   - Setting up CI/CD workflows with secrets

3. **SSL Certificate Setup**:
   - Installing Certbot
   - Obtaining SSL certificates
   - Creating a local certs directory with proper permissions
   - Copying certificates to the app directory
   - Setting up certificate renewal

4. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Adding A record for app.ethcluj.org

5. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Resolving port conflicts
   - Fixing permission issues
   - Debugging container health checks

## Automation Opportunities

1. **Initial Server Provisioning Script**:
   - Create a bash script that automates the initial server setup
   - Install required packages (Docker, Docker Compose, Certbot)
   - Create the `deploy` user with appropriate permissions
   - Set up SSH key authentication
   - Configure firewall rules

2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
   - Use Terraform or similar tools to provision the server
   - Define all infrastructure requirements in code
   - Automate DNS record creation

3. **Enhanced CI/CD Workflow**:
   - Expand the workflow to handle first-time setup
   - Include steps for creating necessary directories
   - Add logic for checking if SSL certificates exist and obtaining them if needed
   - Implement proper error handling and rollback mechanisms

4. **Docker Compose Improvements**:
   - Create a more robust production docker-compose file that handles common issues
   - Include health checks with better diagnostics
   - Add volume configurations that handle permissions automatically
   - Implement proper networking with fallbacks

5. **SSL Certificate Automation**:
   - Create a script that handles the entire SSL certificate process
   - Automate certificate renewal and proper permission setting
   - Include validation and testing of certificates

6. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Create a setup wizard for generating the `.env` file
   - Implement secure secrets management
   - Add validation for required environment variables

7. **Monitoring and Self-healing**:
   - Add monitoring for container health
   - Implement automatic recovery for failed containers
   - Set up logging and alerting

8. **Backup and Restore**:
   - Automate database backups
   - Create a restore procedure
   - Implement backup rotation

9. **Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the deployment process
   - Include troubleshooting guides for common issues
   - Add a quick start guide for new deployments

10. **Testing**:
    - Add automated tests for the deployment process
    - Implement smoke tests to verify the deployment
    - Create a staging environment for testing changes

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize the automation opportunities based on frequency of use and complexity
2. Create a roadmap for implementing the automation
3. Start with the most critical items (server provisioning, SSL automation)
4. Develop and test each automation component
5. Document the automated processes
