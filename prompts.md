BACKEND Speakers Info: Now let's add a new feature on the backend - we need a new API (/speakers) that lists information related to speakers. The data is read from another tab ("Speakers") of the same google sheet that has the following format:

Name	Org	Social	Photo	Visible	Bio

Photo - is a link to an image (ex: https://formester.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/forms/93f1bef3-1433-4445-9b4b-f4b0599d2b45/submissions/afde729b-7b6b-49a7-928e-617ba69822c3/submission_attachments/2907ab03-e1d8-48fa-b6b0-60ca25cd3238/rainbow.jpg)

Visible - if false, the speaker is not displayed.

The name acts as an identifier.
